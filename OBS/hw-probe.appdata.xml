    <p>
      A tool to check operability of computer hardware and upload result
      to the Linux hardware database.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probe â€” is a snapshot of your computer hardware state and logs.
      The tool checks operability of devices by analysis of logs and
      returns a permanent url to view the probe of the computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The probes are intended to simplify collecting of logs necessary for
      investigating hardware related problems. Just run one simple command
      to check hardware and collect all the system logs at once:
    </p>
    <p>
      sudo hw-probe -all -upload
    </p>
    <p>
      If some of your computer devices does not work due to a missed driver
      then the tool will suggest a proper Linux kernel version according
      to the LKDDb or third-party drivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Private info is not collected.

      By creating probes you contribute to the HDD/SSD Real-Life
      Reliability Test study: https://github.com/linuxhw/SMART
